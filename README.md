# Features

- Change the color of- or turn off most vanilla tooltip lines. Set the alpha value to 0 to turn a line off.
- Change the position and line spacing of the tooltip.
- Show the item's full-size sprite.
- Ammo Line
  - Shows the item's ammo's name, amount and rarity, shows the mod that adds the ammo if "Mod name next to item name" is on and shows the ammo the item needs if the item has no ammo. Works with fishing poles and tile wands.
- Better Price Line
  - Correct sell price for items with custom price, always visible, better color coding, cleaner. Replaces vanilla price line.

  - Shows attacks per second. Replaces vanilla speed line.
- Better Knockback Line
  - Shows knockback as a number. Replaces vanilla knockback line.
- Combines weapon and ammo damage and weapon and ammo velocity and combines weapon and ammo knockback if "Better Knockback Line" is on.
- Shows the mod that adds the item next to the item's name.
- Adds a background to tooltips.
- Gives text that appears when hovering over items with custom rarity that are dropped or in the hotbar the right color and shows the name of the frontmost dropped item instead of the backmost.
- Turn off text pulse.

## Disclaimer for programmers
This code is absolutely horrendous and I'm sorry for those who try to read it. I should have redone this instead of forking it. Good luck.

## What happened to the original mod?
My best guess is that the original creator saw [the 20+ discord messages making fun of his code](https://discord.com/channels/103110554649894912/271236615823687680/934934445260177458), or [this issue on his GitHub page](https://discord.com/channels/103110554649894912/271236615823687680/934964011253006366), so he got frustrated and deleted every trace of his mod. Needless to say I was very disappointed to find these messages even if the code was pretty terrible. He made the mod for fun, and it worked. No reason to shame someone for that.
